## Horiseon SEO Website

Challenge 01 of the Front End bootcamp is to refactor a website for better accessibility and SEO performance.

## Changes

The web page now has semantic HTML elements used throughout which has reduced the need for class names.

Also, the CSS has been optimised by reducing unnecessary repetion and utilising the cascade for colors and font families.
